# FlexiSAF Week 6 – Implementing Service Classes

## 🧩 Overview
This project is part of the **FlexiSAF Java Spring Boot Training (Week 6)**.  
The focus of this week is on **implementing service classes**, **dependency injection**, and **autowiring best practices** for clean, modular business logic design.

We refactored our previous week’s project to separate concerns between:
- **Controller Layer** – handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer** – contains business logic.
- **Repository Layer** – handles data persistence.

---

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
- Understand and apply **Dependency Injection (DI)** using constructors, setters, and field injection.
- Use the `@Service` and `@Autowired` annotations correctly.
- Follow best practices for **clean, maintainable code structure** in Spring Boot.
- Refactor existing controllers to use service classes instead of calling repositories directly.

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3.x**
